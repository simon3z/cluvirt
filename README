The daemon requires openais and libvirtd up and running. It has been tested on
CentOS 5.3 with openais-0.80.3-22 and libvirt-0.6.4 (built from fedora sources).

Run cluvirtd on each cluster node:

  # cluvirtd

To query the current status:

  # cluvirtadm

Usage Example

  # cluvirtd &
  # cluvirtadm
